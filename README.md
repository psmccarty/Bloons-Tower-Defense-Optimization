This is my final project for the COMP SCI 524 class at UW-Madison. 
It is the creation of a mathematical optimization model to beat a game called Bloons Tower Defense in the most efficient ways possible. 
The code that solves this mathematical model is written in Julia and uses the Gurobi optimizer to do the computations.

The HTML preview is not loading properly on github but you can download and open with no issues to view the appropriate contents. The LaTex on the ipynb file is also not properly rendered but can be seen in the downloaded HTML or by downloading the ipynb and running that cell.
