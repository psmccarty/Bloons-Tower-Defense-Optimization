This is my final project for the COMP SCI 524 class at UW-Madison. 
It is the creation of a mathematical optimization model to beat a game called Bloons Tower Defense in the most efficient ways possible. 
The code that solves this mathematical model is written in Julia and uses the Gurobi optimizer to do the computations.
